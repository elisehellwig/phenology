## File Descriptions

This section constitutes descriptions of all the files in this repository, what they do, what other files are required to run them, as well as their data inputs and outputs. These descrptions are general overviews and to not go into specific discussions of the code in each file. For more detailed documentation, please review the comments in the file of interest.

### Preprocess/

#### __1_walnut_prep.R__ 
This script imports raw walnut flowering and harvest data from a number of files. The data is merged and then reformatted. Year-cultivars with multiple dates for a given phenological event have the dates averaged so there is one date for each event, for each cultivar, for each year. Specific cultivars of interest are selected and the data is saved as a csv. 
	
* Input Files:
	* raw/crop/WalnutBreedProgram_Locations.csv
	* raw/crop/walnut1954.csv
	* raw/crop/walnutpope2.csv
	* raw/crop/walnutbloompope.csv
	* raw/crop/WalnutJarvisSheanData2018_10.csv
* Output Files: phenology/walnutclean.csv


#### __2_almond_prep.R__ 
This script imports raw almond flowering and harvest data from three files. The data is reformatted so it all has the same form. Columns are renamed as are some of the locations and phenological events. Specifically, 10% flowering is selected as the flowering event (event1) because it is most consistently reported across the data. Specific cultivars are also extracted. Finally, the data from the three sources is merged together and saved as a csv. Required source file: functions/preprocessfunctions.R

* Input Files:
	* clean/croploc.csv
	* raw/crop/AlmondChicoModestoBloom.csv
	* raw/crop/NSVAlmond.csv
	* raw/crop/RAVTHullsplitandBloom.csv
* Output Files: phenology/almondclean.csv


#### __3_prune_prep.R__ 
This script imports raw prune flowering and harvest data from two files. The data is reformatted so it all has the same form. Specific cultivars are also extracted. Finally, the data from the two sources is merged together and saved as a csv. Required source file: functions/preprocessfunctions.R

* Input Files:
    * clean/croploc.csv
    * raw/crop/french1988.csv
    * raw/crop/NSVPrune.csv
* Output Files: phenology/pruneclean.csv

#### __4_clim_prep.R__ 
This script cleans daily temperature data (min, max) from the [NCDC](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)(Daily Summaries) and hourly temperature data from [CIMIS](https://cimis.water.ca.gov/WSNReportCriteria.aspx) for Chico, Davis, Modesto and Parlier. This included removing data that was clearly incorrect, and filling in missing data. To fill in missing data, temperature data from surrounding weather stations was downloaded for each primary location. This data was then related to the primary location data using a series of linear models. The linear models were then used to predict temperatures for the missing days using model averaging, using R^2 as the measure of goodness of fit (see function fillinTemps() in functions/cleanTemps.R). Daily and hourly temperature time series were then saved as csv files, for later temperature interpolation. Required source file: functions/cleanTemps.R

#### __5_process_clim.R__ 
This script uses the hourly temperature data.frames from __4_prep_clim.R__ to calibrate temperature interpolation functions for each of the 4 locations. It then uses those functions to interpolate the daily temperature data __4_prep_clim.R__. Finally, it merges the hourly temperatures and interpolated hourly temperatures together into a data.frame where there is hourly temperature for all days in the time series but CIMIS data is picked preferentially over interpolated NCDC data. Finally the temperature time series for the four locations are merged and saved. Required source files: functions/tempInterpolation.R, functions/datetime.R

* Input Files:
    * clean/noaachico.csv
    * clean/noaadavis.csv
    * clean/noaamodesto.csv
    * clean/noaaparlier.csv
    * clean/cimischicodurham.csv
    * clean/cimisdavis.csv
    * clean/cimismodesto.csv
    * clean/cimisparlier.csv

* Output Files:
    * phenology/dailyhourlytemp.RDS
    * phenology/dailyhourlytemp.csv

#### __6_monthlytempprep.R__
This script takes the min and max daily temperatures from phenology/dailyhourly.RDS and averages them by month to create a time series of average min and max temperatures for each month (same method as NCDC monthly averages). It also does this for the annual average min and max temperatures. Finally, it creates a 5 year moving average for the annual temperatures and saves all generated data. Required source file:  functions/cleanTemps.R

* Input File: phenology/dailyhourlytemp.RDS

* Output Files:
    * history/annualtemperatures.csv
    * history/monthlytemperatures.csv

#### __7_precipprep.R__
THis script takes precipitation data from the NCDC and prepares it for use predicting flowering. It creates two variables by aggregating the monthly data, annual precipitation and winter precipitation (precip in Nov, Dec, and Jan). Additionally, it sets the year to start at March 1 so that flowering that happens in the spring is predicted by winter precipitation the previous year.

* Input File: raw/climate/precipNOAA.csv
* Output File: history/precipitation.csv
