Meeting with Katherine Jarvis-Shean, 3-14-19
 - It is a good idea to just to harvest for the history paper.
 - Third paper will just be optimizing bloom for walnut, almond and prune.
 - Still need to implement overlap
 - Could use chill portions or chilling because that is what is used outside of horticulture
 - For walnut paper, need to put together a 10 slide presentation for end of april for the walnut research people (Chuck Leslie etc.)
